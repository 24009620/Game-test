# Game-test
I'm creating a game.

*Instructions for map or smthn for Pycharm because that's what I use.*

1. Downlad Pycharm and Python and then inside of Pycharm install the Ursina library via interpretors inside of settings.
2. Download the Plains test and move the model to: "C:\Users\USERNAME\PycharmProjects\PythonProject\.venv\Lib\site-packages\ursina\models" Change the drive name and username accordingly to your own computer.
3. Run the game.
