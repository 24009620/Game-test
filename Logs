This file will go about each version of the game and my feelings.

0.1 - Player
  - Really cool movement and setings to make the game an actual 3D game with movement.

0.2 - Map
   - Had fun developing the map in blender. First time I can actaully use blender to make something of value rather than a mess.

0.3 - Lighting
  - Really cool how lighting works. using the main source of light and an ambient map is intersting when moving objects  (NO OBJECTS IN PORVIDED FILES YET).

0.4 - Running
  - I'm genuinely losing my mind over this (19/01/2024)
